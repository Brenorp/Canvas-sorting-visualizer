This is simple project to visualize Sorting Algorithms using Canvas JS for animations. The intent of the project is mainly to learn JavaScript - and in the future some frameworks for it - in a way that is fun and engaging.

It currently only supports BubbleSort and has no user interaction. 

Here's a GIF of the animation:
